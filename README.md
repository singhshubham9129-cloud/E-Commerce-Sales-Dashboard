•	📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
•	📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4.	Data Source
Source: Madhav Store Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/madhav-store-dataset)
Data on Madhav Ecommerce Sales from around India, including details on their location, prices,Order ID, Amount, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category & PaymentMode for each month of 2018.


5.	Features / Highlights
Business Problem: The business likely struggled with fragmented sales data, making it difficult to track profitability across different regions, time periods, and product categories. Without a centralized view, stakeholders couldn't quickly identify which months were loss-making, which payment methods were preferred, or which specific sub-categories were driving the most profit.
Goal of the Dashboard: The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive 360-degree view of ecommerce performance. It aims to empower management to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales and profit, analyze customer purchasing behavior, and identify geographic or product-based growth opportunities to optimize the supply chain and marketing spend.

Profit - Loss by Month: A bar chart showing seasonal trends; it highlights strong performance in early Q1 and December, while revealing losses in months like May and July.
Top States & Customers: Horizontal bar and column charts that identify Maharashtra as the lead state and Harivansh as the top-spending customer.
Category & Payment Breakdowns: Donut charts showing that Clothing dominates quantity (63%) and COD (Cash on Delivery) is the most popular payment method at 44%.

Business Impact
Operational Efficiency: Identifying that Clothing accounts for 63% of quantity allows for better inventory and warehouse space management.
Financial Optimization: By seeing losses in specific months (e.g., May), the business can investigate underlying causes—such as high returns or failed marketing campaigns—to prevent future deficits.
Targeted Marketing: Knowing that Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are top regions allows for localized ad campaigns to maximize ROI.
Strategic Growth: High profits in Printers despite potentially lower volumes suggest a high-margin area worth expanding.
